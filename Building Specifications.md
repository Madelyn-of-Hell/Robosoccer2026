- Requirements:
	- Should be maximum feasible size
	- Should have wheel positions denoted (needs wells for our motors)
	- Should have dedicated place for light sensor PCB in base
	- Should have dedicated position for OTOS in base
	- Should have dedicated dribbler well
	- Should have  dedicated camera well (needs to house the openmv camera and suspend the 100mm ball an arbitrary distance away.)
	- Should have dedicated well for rotary encoder (doesn't need to be precise for now, just a general alotted place to put it in the structure)
	- Should have dedicated well for batteries (doesn't need to be precise for now, just a general alotted place to put it in the structure)
	- Should have dedicated well for speed controller (doesn't need to be precise for now, just a general alotted place to put it in the structure)
