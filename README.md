# Robosoccer2026

##### Research
- PCB design/building
- Bluetooth chip
- Colour/light sensors
- Camera
- Microcontroller
	- FARLEY'S RECOMMENDATION: **ESP** MICROCONTROLLER
	- Teensy 4.1
	- Arduino
	- RasPi
- Servos
	- Servo type? (brushless / stepper?)
	- Needs decent torque so we're not pushed around by competitors
- Omni wheels
	- Bigger means we need less fast motors
- Gyroscope (compass; we just need yaw)
- Position sensor???? (Optical Tracking Odomotry Sensor)
	- Teach robots to chart courses and relay them to one another so they don't collide.
- Dribbler?
	- Consider hiding the ball behind the robot (like in open, but not really done in lightweight)
- Carapace
	- Mainly 3D printed
	- Padded base to prevent damage?
	- Electronic components should have dedicated wells to avoid getting knocked out of place in case of collision

##### Points to note from other competitors
- If robots are relying on communication, make them check if the other is still present every so often and have a plan for if it's not (e.g. switch to attack mode)
